## Introduction

This is an out-of-the-box **æ°´å¢¨(shuimo)** component library.

We have found that there are many excellent enterprise-level UI design languages and component libraries.

As a Chinese, we highly respect the unique Chinese art style: shuimo.

We have sorted out a set of Shuimo component library with traditional Chinese style.

I hope that this traditional Chinese-style component library can be used for some niche needs, and can satisfy some
users who have an artistic pursuit of the site and hope to build it quickly.

At the same time, we hope to contribute a little effort to help Chinese traditional culture become more widely known.

It looks like this:

## Merchandise

We've discovered that the `Shuimo UI` design style can be applied to some interesting places, so we've produced some merchandise, which is being iterated and released gradually.

Currently, we can share with you a set of Shuimo style wallpapers.
